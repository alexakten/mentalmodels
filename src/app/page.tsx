    definition:
      "First Principles Thinking involves deconstructing a problem into its basic truths and reasoning up from there, enabling innovative solutions.",
    example:
      "When faced with a problem, first principles thinking involves breaking it down into its fundamental components, such as the basic principles of physics or the fundamental principles of a business. By starting with these basic truths, you can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and create innovative solutions that are not limited by existing assumptions or constraints.",

    summary: "80% of outcomes come from 20% of inputs.",
    definition:
      "The Pareto Principle suggests focusing on the few inputs that yield the most significant results, often applied in productivity and business.",
    example:
      "The Pareto Principle can be applied to many areas of life, such as productivity, business, and personal finance. For example, if you spend 80% of your time on 20% of your tasks, you can focus on those tasks and delegate the rest to others. This can help you achieve more in less time and improve your overall productivity.",

    summary: "Think backwards to avoid failure.",
    definition:
      "Inversion involves thinking about what you want to avoid or what could go wrong to ensure success by planning against negative outcomes.",
    example:
      "Inversion can be applied to many areas of life, such as business, personal finance, and relationships. For example, if you want to avoid failure in a business, you can think about what could go wrong and plan against it. This can help you avoid common pitfalls and ensure your success.",
